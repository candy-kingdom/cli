_Clean and elegant CLI development kit._

## Overview

{Name} is a micro-framework that allows you to build CLI apps in declarative and natural way.
It's a lightweight alternative to Click, Plac or Fire with the annotations based API.

Consider a following example as a demonstration of {Name} capabilities:
```py
# say.py

from candies.cli import cli, Arg, Flag, Opt

@cli
def say(phrase: Arg('A phrase to print.'),
        caps:   Flag('Whether to print phrase in upper-case.'),
        times:  Opt[int]('How many times to print.') = 1):
    """Prints a phrase specified number of times."""

    for i in range(0, times):
        print(phrase.upper() if caps else phrase)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    cli()
```
